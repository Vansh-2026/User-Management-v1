 * Defines responsive breakpoints for form controls in relation to the width of the Form component.
 * Each breakpoint can specify a minimum and/or maximum width, and a value that represents either the number of columns

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const breakpoints: ResponsiveFormBreakPoint[] = [
 *   { minWidth: 768, value: 2 },
 *   { maxWidth: 767, value: 1 }
 * ];
