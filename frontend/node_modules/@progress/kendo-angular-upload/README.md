The [Kendo UI for Angular Uploads](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/uploads/) package contains two components that help users select files from their file systems and send them to dedicated server handlers configured to receive them.

## What's Included in the Angular Uploads Package

* [Angular Upload Component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/uploads/upload/)&mdash;Enables users to upload files from their local systems to dedicated server handlers which are configured to receive them. It offers several features, including batch and chunk upload modes, dragging and dropping files from the file system, etc.
* [Angular FileSelect Component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/uploads/fileselect/)&mdash;The FileSelect builds on the functionality of Upload component to offer you more control over the selected user files, when and how to upload them. It is a richer version of an `<input type='file'>` element and supports model binding, templates, forms, and more.
